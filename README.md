# QuWalkEC.jl

## Package description


QuWalkEC.jl is a package for [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) which enables checking and finding subgraphs with stationary states for coined quantum walk, see [1]. Those state
usually result in exceptional configuration, ie. hard to find combination of marked elements.

Currently package is under construction.

## Installation

QSWalk requires [LightGraphs package for Julia](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl). This package will be installed automatically with QuWalkEC installation.

QuWalkEC can be installed directly form GitHub repository.

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/QuantumWalks/QuWalkEC.jl.git")
```
